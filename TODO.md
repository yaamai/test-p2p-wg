- [ ] implement nat traversal
  - [ ] append self public key to communication target peer (pubkey: self.pubkey, allowed-ip: self.ip)
  - [ ] get target endpoint and target tunnel ip from target's successor
  - [ ] append target peer pubkey to self (pubkey: target.pubkey, endpoint: target.ep, allowed_ip: target.tunnel_ip)
  - [ ] add ip route on target peer
    - maybe `/16` route are sufficient
